# Implement-Matrix-class: In this repository, the functions for Matrix Addition/Subtraction, Matrix Multiplication, Scalar Multiplication are also been developed.

Glossary
Scalar - A scalar is just a number like 1.2, -5, 0, or 239. When we use the word scalar it's usually to highlight that we are not talking about a vector or a matrix.
$$\begin{bmatrix}1.5 & -9.2 & 0 \\
5.4 & 7 & 2.2\end{bmatrix}$$
Matrix - A matrix is a rectangular grid of numbers. For example, this is a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns so we would call it a 2*3 "2 by 3" matrix.:

Row / Column - These terms describe the horizontal (row) and vertical (column) sequences of numbers in a matrix. 

Vector - A vector is a matrix where either the width or the height is 1. When the height is 1, it's called a row vector. When the width is 1 it's called a column vector.

Matrix Element - The element in the first row and first column of the matrix given above is the number 1.5

Square Matrix - A matrix is square when its height is equal to its width.

Main Diagonal - The main diagonal of a square matrix is the sequence of elements from the top left to bottom right. For the matrix below the main diagonal refers 
to the numbers 2 and 6.

Identity Matrix - This is a special square matrix where all of the elements are equal to zero except those on the main diagonal, which are equal to 1. 
This is a 3*3 identity matrix:

Indexing with  𝐀𝑖𝑗 
The numbers  𝑖  and  𝑗  are used to refer to the row number and column number of a matrix (respectively).

NOTE: The top left element of a matrix is typically given by  𝐀11  and not  𝐀00 .

Summation with  ∑ 
Summation is best described by example.
∑𝑖=1𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑛
This equation can be read as "The sum from i equals one to n of the matrix element at row  𝑛 , column  𝑛 ."
When you see  ∑  you should think "for loop". The code below demonstrates the following mathematical equation:
∑𝑖=1𝑛∑𝑗=1𝑚𝑎𝑖𝑗
